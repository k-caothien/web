        <h2>Ramen</h2>
        <p>
           Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup dish consisting of wheat flour noddles, broth, and a variety of toppings: nori-dried sewweed, scallion, chashu-sliced pork, etc. There are a wide range of broths. The most common ones are: shoyu-soy sauce, shio-salt, miso, tonkotsu-pork. This dish is normally a hot dish; however, there are different variations. Hiyashi chuka is a cold variation of ramen normally eaten in the summer. It is accompanied with sauce instead of broth. Recently, ramen burgers have gained popularity as well. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ramen-burger/index.html">ramen burger</a> is a burger where the buns are constructed of ramen noodles. Also, different regions of Japan have different ramen specialities. For example, Sapporo is known for their miso ramen. Thus, many people visit there to try out the ramen, it is perfect for the cold weather in Sapporo. Instant ramen is also very popular as it is very accessible and easy to prepare. My favorite ramen is shoyu ramen. My favorite instant ramen is cup noodle seafood flavor.

        <h2>Udon</h2>
        <p>
         Udon is thick wheat flour noodles that are eaten both cold and hot. There are different <a href="https://www.tsunagujapan.com/all-about-udon-and-its-regional-varieties/">variations of cold and hot udon noodles.</a> One type of cold udon is zaru udon, which consists of udon, dashi sauce for dipping. The dashi sauce is concentrated so very little is necessary. In the sauce we add some ginger, and wasabi. Nori and sesame seeds can be added onto the noodles directly or the sauce. This is not the only type of cold udon other types include bukkake udon, salad udon, etc. Hot udon usually consist of noodles in hot broth and a variety of toppings. My favorite being curry udon and kitsune udon. Curry udon has curry flavored broth and an assortment of vegeatbles and beef. Kistune udon is topped with fired tofu that is sweetened. With hot udon shichimi, a spice is normally added. Also, tempura is often eaten alongside udon. Tempura consists of fried vegeatbles and fish mostly shrimp. Instant udon is also produced but not as common as instant ramen. My favorite instant udon is maruchan akai kitsune udon.

    <h2>Soba</h2>
    <p>
        Soba is thin buckwheat noodles that have a gray color. Similar to udon it is eaten cold with a dipping sauce or hot in a broth. There are many variations of soba. The most common being zaru soba, which is eaten very similar to zaru udon. A common additive to soba is tororo. Tororo is grated yamaimo, Japanese yam. Hot soba is eaten with a soy based dashi broth. The different toppings include tampura, wakame-seaweed, etc. An intesesting type of soba is cha soba, which is green tea soba noodles. This is eaten both hot and cold. Soba is often associated with <a href = https://www.ana-cooljapan.com/contents/washoku/movie/soba/INT13071039#:~:text=Rooted%20in%20Japanese%20food%20culture,to%20bring%20longevity%20and%20prosperity).>Japanese culture</a> and eaten on many important days. For example, Toshikoki Soba is soba eaten on New Year's Eve. Soba noodles are soft; therefore, when biting the noodles one is essentially cutting off one's bad luck. The noodles are very long and thin showing long life. Instant soba is available but not common like ramen, or udon.
